bitter_water="""Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh

Oh, fair and flighty love
My aerolite above
The only dove I see
Could you love me more
If by the Sun and Moon I swore
That I would never flee?

I still taste you on my lips
Lovely bitter water
The terrible fire of old regret is honey on my tongue
And I know I shouldn't love you
I know I shouldn't love you, but I do

Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh

I feel it in my soul
I feel the empty hole
The cup that can't be filled
And I feel it in my blood
In the fire and the flood
The beast that can't be killed

Even now you mark my steps
Lovely bitter water
All the days of our delights are poison in my veins
I know I shouldn't love you, I know

Oh, oh, uh, uh
Oh, oh

Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh

I am not a fool entire
No, I know what is coming
You'll bury me beneath the tree I climbed when I was a child
I know I shouldn't love you
I know I shouldn't love you, but I do"""

Exeunt=""" I was all alone
We were young, you were like wine
Heady as the fog rolling in
O'er the hillside

Now, I am not the fool I was when I was younger
Crocodile eyes I have seen how you hunger
Fluttering your lashes like ashes and embers
Warm and bright as fire, devouring timber
No, I cannot trust what you say when you're grieving
So, my love, I'm sorry, but still I am leaving

Even when you hunt me with ire, relentless
Batter down my door when you find me defenseless
I will not abide all your raging and reaving
I have set my mind and my will, I am leaving"""

You are my special

[Verse 1]
Enjoy the moment, let's dance
On the frontline of Tokyo, the thriving city
Struggle on the verge of giving up
Show me your fearless side

[Pre-Chorus]
I love you, baby
Let's keep eulogizing
No matter how ignorant
No matter how homeless
Every heart-burning move
Once we start running, it's unable to turn back
You are my special

[Chorus]
Could you mess these up more?
Devour evеrything heartily
A lifetime of wandеring in a maze
Rendezvous, dizziness
"You are my special"
A world spinning in ambiguity
No, no, no! No more composure
A lifetime of wandering in a maze
No matter what others say
"You are my special"
"We are special"

[Verse 2]
At the edge of the sumo ring, let's endure
Along the Tokyo frontlines, it's only chaos
Media rushes among the sea of corpses and blood
Calmness or detachment are both forbidden

[Bridge]
"Get lost in me"
Only words that protect yourself
How long are you gonna keep doing this?
"Get lost in me"
Won't regret the way of life
This is the path I chose
Please answer me, I wanna feel your heatwave
Blue flame flow from hypothermia
Don't deceive romantically, just cut to the chase
No longer get drunk on this love song
I love you, baby
I love you, baby

[Breakdown]
Enjoy the moment, let's dance
On the frontline of Tokyo, the thriving city
Struggle on the verge of giving up
Fearless side
You are my special
[Chorus]
Could you mess these up more?
Devour everything heartily
A lifetime of wandering in a maze
Rendezvous, dizziness
"You are my special"
A world spinning in ambiguity
No, no, no! No more composure
A lifetime of wandering in a maze
No matter what others say
"You are my special"

[Post-Chorus]
We are special
No more composure
We are special
Stay as who you are
We are special
Be special all the way
We are special
No matter what others say

[Outro]
You are my special

Hear on the wind how the pendulum swings
Feel how the winter succumbs to the spring
Over the palisade morning will break
Rise up to meet it, oh sleeper awake

Gather the soldiers, the heir to enfold
Crown him and give him a scepter to hold
Sound every horn as the columns extend
Up to the hill where the king will ascend

Look to the sky where the sign will be shown
Heaven and earth and the king on his throne
Look to the sky where the sign will be shown

No, I am not afraid to die
It's every breath that comes before
Heartache, I've heard, is part of life
And I have broken more and more

But I can hope how this will end
With every line a comedy
That we could learn to love without demand
But unreserved honesty

If I am not afraid to die
And you are crouching at my door
And suffering is all there is to gain in life
Then what is all this waiting for?

I can see how this will end
In all its bitter tragedy
I'll give you all I have to spend
And you'll give nothing back to me

And I will wait for this to end
The back and forth, the battery
For you, at last, to comprehend
The kind of love of which I speak

Down they fell like the children of Eden
Down they fell like the tower
As the land relinquished her ghost

Heed the sirens, take shelter, my lover
Flee the fire that devours
But the sight held me fixed
Like a bayonet against my throat

Neither plague or famine tempered my courage
Nor did raids make me cower
But his translucent skin
Made me shiver deep within my bones

It was a pale white horse
With a crooked smile
And I knew it was my time

It was the raging storm
Of a foreign war
And a face I'd seen before

rider="""Was it you 'mid the fire and the ember?
Were you there to bedevil and beguile?
See, your face wasn't quite as I remember
But I know that wicked shape to your smile
Bury me as it pleases you, lover
At sea, or deep within the catacomb
But these bones never rested while living
So how can they stand to languish in repose?

He has thrown down the cavalry as gravel sinks
And as the stone founders underneath the sundered sea of red and reed
The shadow of Hades is fading
For he has cast down leviathan, the tyrant, and the horse and rider

Where is your rider?

He will hold with all of his might the armies of night,
Still as boulders laid to the side 'til we pass by
He has hoisted out of the mire every child
So lift your voice with timbrel and lyre
"We will abide, we will abide, we will abide"

When I was a child, I didn't hear a single word you said
The things I was afraid of, they were all confined beneath my bed
But the years have been long, and you have taught me well to hide away
The things that I believed in, you've taught me to call them all escapes

I know who you are now

There before the threshold, I saw a brighter world beyond myself
And in my hour of weakness, you were there to see my courage fail
For the years have been long, and you have taught me well to sit and wait
Planning without acting, steadily becoming what I hate

I know who you are now

I have always known you, you have always been there in my mind
But now I understand you, and I will not be part of your designs

I know who I am now
And all that you've made of me
I know who you are now
And I name you my enemy

I know who I am now
I know who I want to be
I want to be more than this devil inside of me

Let me die, let me drown, lay my bones in the ground
I will still come around when the time for sleep is through
Over hill, over dale, through the valley and vale
Do not weep, do not wail, I am coming home to you
Every tomb, every sea, spit the bones from your teeth
Let the ransomed be free as the revel meets the day
Let the valleys awake, let them rattle and shake
In the wind that remakes all that time has worn away

To and fro, I will not follow
Where you go, I will not also

I will look for you as the sun rises higher
When the dry bones dance with the timbrel and lyre
There's a wind alive in the valley
It will fill your lungs, if you'll have it

Where I go, will you still follow?
Will you leave your shaded hollow?
Will you greet the daylight looming,
Learn to love without consuming?
